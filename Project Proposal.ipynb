I would use a scatter plot for this data to try to see if there seems to be a loose connection visible for this.\n",

    "For my analysis, I would try to perform linear regression, and see if I could model a line to describe this data. My null hypothesis would be \"there is no connection between these two\", and an alternative would be that \"there is some impact on social media time to number of meaningful interactions per day\". I would then look at the coefficients of my model, and see the slope and if its non-zero, and then verify the integrity of my conclusion by looking at the R squared and p value of this data.\n",

    "My hypothesis is that there is no connection between time on social media and meaningful connections. I think that meaningful connection is more dependent on the people you talk to, instead of the amount of time you talk to, and I think that especially on social media it is possible for people to spend large amounts of time and reach no meaningful connection with people. \n",

Personally, I knew very little of my neighbours at home, and times when I felt lonely/not lonely really didn't matter on my neighbours.
